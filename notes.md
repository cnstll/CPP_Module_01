# Day 01: Dynamic Memory Allocation and references (&)
## Some definitions
memory allocation comes in two varieties:
* **Static (compile time)**: Sizes and types of memory (including arrays) must be known at compile time.
* **Dynamic (run-time)**: Memory allocated at run time. Exact sizes (like the size of an array)
* can be variable. Dynamic memory doesn't have a name (names known by compiler), so pointers
* are used to link to this memory
